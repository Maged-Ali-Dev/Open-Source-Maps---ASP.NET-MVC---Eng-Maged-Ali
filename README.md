OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js - ASP.NET MVC

Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js in an ASP.NET MVC application. Leaflet.js is a powerful, open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, and OpenStreetMap provides free, editable map data. This application showcases how to embed a responsive map into an ASP.NET MVC view.

Features

- Interactive Map: Displays an interactive map using Leaflet.js.
- OpenStreetMap Tiles: Uses OpenStreetMap tiles for rendering the map.
- Responsive Design: The map adjusts its size based on the viewport to ensure a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

#Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK: Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

#Setup

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-source-maps-aspnet-mvc.git
   cd open-source-maps-aspnet-mvc
   ```

2. Open the Project

   Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

3. Install Dependencies

   Ensure all required packages are installed by running:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Run the Application

   Start the application using:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   The application will start and you can navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to see the interactive map.

Code Explanation

#View (`Index.cshtml`)

- HTML Structure: The page contains a `<div>` with an ID of `map` where the Leaflet map will be rendered.
- CSS:
  - `html, body`: Ensures the map container uses the full height and width of the viewport.
  - `#map`: Sets the height of the map to fill the viewport height (`100vh`) and width to 100%.
  - Responsive Design: Uses a media query to adjust the map height on smaller screens (e.g., devices with a max-width of 600px).
- JavaScript:
  - Initializes the Leaflet map centered on New York City.
  - Adds OpenStreetMap tile layers to the map.
  - Configures basic map controls and settings.

#Running the Application

The application can be run using the `dotnet run` command, which will start a development server. Access the map at `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
